<p>Howdy,</p><p>Today we are happy to announce another milestone regarding ISC DHCP removal: the arrival of a DHCRelay replacement based on code forked and maintained by OpenBSD.  While here the whole DHCP relay section was moved to MVC/API for the usual reasons and now offers a combined GUI for both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 relay.  As a special treat this also includes being able to run ISC DHCP as well as any desired relay at the same time.</p><p>The feedback for the WireGuard peer generator was quite extensive so a few more tweaks and fixes have been done in that area.  Thank you for all the responses regarding that feature addition!</p><p>Otherwise this update simply moves ahead with security-related third party updates in OpenSSL and PHP.</p><p>Last but not least we are releasing the OPNProxy (formerly business) plugin to the community version for fine-grained access control using Squid with Redis as a database backend.  For more details please consult the available documentation linked below.</p><p>Here are the full patch notes:</p><p><ul><li>firewall: show automation rules in their own section</li><li>firewall: keep permissions to standard for filter.lock file</li><li>firewall: replace searchNoCategoryItemAction() with new searchBase() extension</li><li>firewall: add gateway to the states diagnostics output</li><li>firewall: fix visible rows quantity off-by-one (contributed by NYOB)</li><li>intrusion detection: query all fields for searchBase() actions</li><li>dhcrelay: functional MVC/API replacement using the OpenBSD dhcrelay(6) fork</li><li>isc-dhcp: fix log file location</li><li>wireguard: add DNS field to peer generator and store previous used values in instance</li><li>wireguard: add address field to peer generator which auto-calculates the next available address in the pool</li><li>wireguard: add restart action to available cron tasks (contributed by Michael Muenz)</li><li>wireguard: unlink instance on peer delete</li><li>mvc: extend searchBase() to return all fields when no list is provided</li><li>mvc: fix config locking issue when already owning the lock</li><li>plugins: add globbing for plugin run tasks as well</li><li>plugins: os-OPNProxy 1.0.5 business plugin released to community version[<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.opnsense.org/vendor/deciso/opnproxy.html">1</a>]</li><li>plugins: os-acme-client 4.2[<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/opnsense/plugins/blob/stable/24.1/security/acme-client/pkg-descr">2</a>]</li><li>plugins: os-caddy 1.5.4[<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/opnsense/plugins/blob/stable/24.1/www/caddy/pkg-descr">3</a>]</li><li>plugins: os-zabbix-proxy 1.10[<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/opnsense/plugins/blob/stable/24.1/net-mgmt/zabbix-proxy/pkg-descr">4</a>]</li><li>ports: dhcrelay 0.4[<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/opnsense/dhcrelay">5</a>]</li><li>ports: openssl fix for CVE-2024-2511[<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-ports/commit/3d9fc064b7">6</a>]</li><li>ports: php 8.2.18[<a target="_blank" href="https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-8.php#8.2.18">7</a>]</li></ul></p><p><br>Stay safe,<br> Your OPNsense team</p>
